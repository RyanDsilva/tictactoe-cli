<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project


So, I was randomly thinking about games you can play in the terminal and had this lightbulb moment: why not make one myself? And what's easier to start with than good old Tic Tac Toe? Just for kicks, I decided to whip up this fun project on a lazy Sunday. Turned out to be a pretty cool way to spend the day!

On a more serious note, I did try to incorporate best practices and extensive documentation for my code. If you want to learn more about the AI algorithm I used, here's a great link that I used myself: [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5y2a0Zhgq0U)
